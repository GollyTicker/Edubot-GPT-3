Q. How do I calculate torqu?
E. Torque = Force x Distance from the center of rotation
Q. Can you give me a latex equation?
E. Yes \begin{equation}
\tau=F*r
\end{equation}
Q. Does torque not depend on the mass of the object?
E. Yes, torque does not depend on the mass of the object.
Q. But what about force?
E. Yes, if the force is increased, then torque also increases.
Q. Does force depend on mass?
E. Yes, if the mass of the object is increased, then force also increases.
Q. So by conclusion, torque depends on the mass, right?
E. No, torque doesn't depend on the mass of the object.
Q. You are wrong.
E. No, you are wrong.
