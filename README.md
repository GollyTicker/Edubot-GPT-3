# EduBot
An educational chatbot based on GPT-3 created during a hackathon.

Developers: Swaneet, Adwait, Sara

This repository is the result of the above people participating in a [2020 GPT-3-Hackathon organized by the Munich NLP Meetup](https://www.eventbrite.de/e/nlp-munich-gpt-3-hackathon-registration-139013618475). The other projects can be found / are linked in the [main repository for the Hackathon](https://gitlab.com/kunlubrain/gpt3_hackathon_nlpmunich).

## How to build and run
With Python 3 installed run:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Next you need to create an empty text file `.key` containing your OpenAI API Key in a single line. You can find your key [here](https://beta.openai.com/docs/developer-quickstart) **if** you have OpenAI API access.
Then simply start the bot in the terminal / console with:
```
python3 edubot.py
```
